This repository contains the structure and outline for the MAPLE website. 
To access it, download the zip files via the green code button and open the index.html file, the first three navigation bar links work 
and if clicked on give sort of an outline of what we can include in these sections. 
In the navigation sidebar I've compiled potential sections the website can have.
As of now we need text for the most crucial sections like about, home and documentation.
